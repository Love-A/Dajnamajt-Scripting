# Love-A
A collection of useful scripts for OSD, device management and application deployment. 
Some scripts are created wholly, or partialy, by myself and some wholly by others which i've found around the internet, i will try to give credit and mention where i can if that is the case.

Hopefully you will find something that helps you or maybe you can help me.

Scripts provided as is, with no liability, and should be tested in a controlled environment.
